tutorials and examples for your Pycom module.

Chapter 3.1 General Pycom tutorials contains tutorials that can be run on any
Pycom board, such as connecting to a WIFI network, Bluetooth, controlling
I/O pins etc.
Sections 3.2 and 3.3 are specific to the LoPy and SiPy such as setting
up a LoRa node or connecting to the Sigfox network.
