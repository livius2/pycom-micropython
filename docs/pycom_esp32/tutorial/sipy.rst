To ensure your device has been provisioned with **Device ID** and **PAC number**, please update to the latest :ref:`firmware <firmware_upgrades>`.

The following tutorials demonstrate how to register and get started with the SiPy. The SiPy can be configured for operation in various countries based upon specified RCZ zones (see the :class:`Sigfox <.Sigfox>` class for more info). The SiPy supports both uplink and downlink Sigfox messages as well as device to device communication via its FSK Mode :class:`Sigfox <.Sigfox>.constants>`.
